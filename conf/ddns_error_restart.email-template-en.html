        Hello,
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>
        Your NameSilo DDNS service has an exception because you have configured the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Charles94jp/NameSilo-DDNS#configuration">auto_restart</a> option,
        which <b>has automatically restarted the NameSilo DDNS service</b> for you. The exception is not necessarily triggered by the DDNS service itself. It may also be caused by the busy api of NameSilo or the failure of services such as speedtest.

        You can connect to the server to view the exception details through the log/DDNS.log file. Please troubleshoot the cause and check whether the DDNS service has been restarted successfully, so as to prevent your server from being unable to be accessed through the domain name due to IP changes.
