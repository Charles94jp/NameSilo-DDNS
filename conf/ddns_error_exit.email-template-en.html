        Hello,
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>
        Your NameSilo DDNS service has stopped due to an exception, which is not necessarily caused by the service itself, but may be due to a busy api of ip138.com or NameSilo.
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>
        You can connect to the server to check the abnormal details through log/DDNS.log file, <b>please check the reason and restart DDNS service as soon as possible</b> to avoid the IP change that your server cannot be accessed through the domain name.
You can also set the automatic restart of DDNS service by configuring the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Charles94jp/NameSilo-DDNS#configuration">auto_restart</a> option.
